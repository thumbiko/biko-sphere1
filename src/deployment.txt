A. Uploading to Netlify

    - Connect your Git repository.
    - Configure build settings (e.g., npm run build for React, gatsby build for Gatsby, etc.).
    - Click "Deploy."
4. For updates, just push to your repository, and Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy.

B. Connecting GoDaddy Domain to Netlify
1. Log in to your GoDaddy account (https://www.godaddy.com/).
2. Navigate to My Domains → Select your domain.
3. Go to the DNS Settings and find the "Nameservers" section.

    - dns2.p07.nsone.net
    - dns3.p07.nsone.net
    - dns4.p07.nsone.net
